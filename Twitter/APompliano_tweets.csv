2021-07-22 23:57:11,56,5,"9/ And because the Roth is such a powerful investing tool, there are limits &amp; restrictions:

- You have to have 'earned income' to be eligible
- If you're single, you have to make less than $125k annually
- Most people are only eligible to contribute $6,000 per year (DYOR)"
2021-07-22 23:57:11,22,4,"8/ For those of you not familiar with Roths:

A Roth IRA is a type of retirement account that enables you to invest tax-free. That's right, as long as you wait until you're 59½ to withdraw the money, you will never pay a penny in taxes on the money in your Roth."

2021-07-22 23:57:09,16,1,"4/ But not everyone has Thiel's access. And most legacy retirement accounts limit you to a handful of cookie-cutter funds.

That's why @choicebykt is building a retirement account for bitcoiners, and turning the Roth IRA into the ultimate Third Stack."
2021-07-22 23:57:09,17,1,"3/ So powerful that Investing legend Peter Thiel was recently highlighted for (legally) accumulating a $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA.

2021-07-22 23:57:08,28,1,"2/ The former US Senator believed that if you work hard, save, and invest you should keep more of your hard-earned money.

https://t.co/RzoJedfRwx"
2021-06-24 02:00:29,222,29,"10/ To summarize:

1. Warren Buffet &amp; other rich Americans do everything they can to game the system &amp; pay less taxes (legally) &amp; you can do the same.

2. One of best ways to do that is by contributing to a retirement account like @choicebykt. (Exactly why they sponsor podcast!)"
2021-06-24 02:00:29,175,26,"9/ Or if you open a Roth IRA like Peter Thiel, your contributions aren't tax-deductible, but you don't have to pay ANY tax when you withdraw it, as long as you wait until you're 59½.

That means you'll have tax free income in the future 💰💰💰

https://t.co/BirC1ZfT9H"
2021-06-24 02:00:28,142,22,"8/ If you open a Traditional IRA with @choicebykt, contributions are deductible but you have to pay income taxes on your withdrawals, even after the age of 59½.

You can reduce your taxable income in 2021 by $6,000 (this is the max contribution for most people, but DYOR)."
2021-06-24 02:00:28,188,27,"7/ There are two main types of IRAs -- Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. While both are tax-efficient, Traditional IRAs lower your taxable income NOW while Roth IRAs reduce your tax burden LATER.

The best part? You don't have to pay capital gains taxes when you trade in either 🤯"
2021-06-24 02:00:28,207,28,"6/ The trouble with that is, historically, IRAs have limited what you're allowed to invest in to cookie-cutter funds.

@choicebykt tore up those limits - now you can stack sats &amp; trade 18 other digital assets alongside stocks &amp; ETFs - all with no capital gains."
2021-06-24 02:00:28,219,23,"5/ While some methods are more attainable for the ultra-rich like Buffet, the most accessible way to reduce your tax burden every year is to contribute to your retirement account.

And the most effective way to avoid taxes on your capital gains is to trade in an IRA."
2021-06-24 02:00:27,296,40,"4/ There's a lot of ways to legally reduce your taxable income including:

Charitable donations
1031 exchanges
Tax-loss harvesting
Deductions for interest payments
Retirement Contributions

Anything the wealthy can do to take advantage of the system, they do. Act accordingly."
2021-06-24 02:00:27,210,22,"3/ First, a lot of Buffet's income comes in the form of capital gains, not wages. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% while the top income tax bracket is 37%.

Second, Buffet and other wealthy Americans have mastered reducing their taxable income."
2021-06-24 02:00:27,228,23,"2/ Without using any deductions or loopholes, Buffet would have paid close to $50 million in federal income taxes. In reality, he paid less than half of that -- only $23.7 million.

So how did he cut his effective tax rate in half?"
2021-06-24 02:00:26,330,35,"1/ Nothing that Buffet, Bezos, Elon, and other wealthy Americans do is illegal. The basic approach is simple:

They minimize their reported income and take whatever deductions are available -- donations, losses, retirement contributions, and more."
2021-06-24 02:00:26,1995,388,"Between 2014 and 2018, Warren Buffet reported $125M in income. His effective tax rate was only 18.9%.

2021-06-22 12:52:20,4,0,@defiDimitri Basically my life strategy :)
2021-06-22 12:51:03,1202,40,"Should go without saying, but this is not financial advice. Do your own research. 

I merely putting this out there to have public documentation of what I'm thinking in the moment and what my plan is :)"
2021-06-22 12:45:26,1737,95,"11/11 So here is what I'm thinking and doing right now:

- Strong belief in bitcoin
- Long term view on asset
- Dollar cost averaging aggressively
- Not worried over short term price
- Plan to hand bitcoin to my grandchildren

Could I be wrong? Sure. I'm not betting on it though."
2021-06-22 12:45:25,897,54,"10/ Given my long time horizon view, the longer bitcoin stays at depressed prices, the more bitcoin I can accumulate at these levels.

This is a weird thing with most bitcoin holders. The strong hands welcome low prices for long periods of time because it helps with accumulation."
2021-06-22 12:45:25,801,36,"9/ I have no clue where the price of bitcoin is going in the short term. It could go higher. It could go lower.

I simply don't know and don't believe most people know either.

However, I know that I want to own as much bitcoin as possible for the long term."
2021-06-22 12:45:24,953,55,"8/ A key reason why I take the long term holding strategy to the extreme is for emotional control and peace of mind.

It is easy to stomach wild price swings when you know you're handing the asset to your grandchildren.

Fear and greed are very real. Insulate yourself from them."
2021-06-22 12:45:24,999,68,"7/ The key to investing in a volatile asset like bitcoin is that you have to size your portfolio allocation correctly.

Don't invest money that you will need for daily expenses or money that you can't afford to lose. 

Markets are volatile. Long term investing means LONG TERM."
2021-06-22 12:45:24,1206,64,"6/ I don't care about the short term price movement of bitcoin after I buy it. Remember, I'm not a trader.

I buy the asset and tell myself that I'm going to hand it to my grandchildren one day.

As Warren Buffett famously says, ""our favorite holding period is forever."""
2021-06-22 12:45:23,806,34,"5/ When the price of bitcoin falls, which it has been doing for the last few weeks, I try to speed up the frequency of my dollar cost averaging. 

Given my oversized exposure to the asset, this isn't always easy. But I do my best and spend most of my time trying to find more $$"
2021-06-22 12:45:23,1168,74,"4/ The dollar cost average strategy relies on the idea that ""time in the market is more important than timing the market.""

This has historically been true in bitcoin. The asset has an annual compound growth rate of over 100% throughout the last decade."
2021-06-22 12:45:22,1118,61,"3/ The idea has always been to dollar cost average into bitcoin.

For those that don't know what this is, I basically buy bitcoin on a periodic basis without caring what the price is. 

Sometimes I buy when price is high. Sometimes I buy when the price is low. Weekly or monthly."
2021-06-22 12:45:22,1194,65,"2/ My strategy with bitcoin over the last few years is simple — accumulate as much bitcoin as I can.

The word accumulate is important. That is an action you do with no intention of selling for profit later."
2021-06-22 12:45:22,1371,66,"1/ I'm not a trader. I don't look at charts and I don't try to time markets. If anything, I'm an atrocious trader who is guaranteed to lose :)

I have a very long-term view of the asset and believe it will continue to accrue value and adoption over the next few decades."
2021-06-22 12:45:21,5463,801,"Bitcoin is under $30,000.
