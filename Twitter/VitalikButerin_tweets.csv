2020-09-02 02:54:45,105,9,"In a rollup-heavy ecosystem, on-chain gas fees would remain the same, and 465 gwei may even become the norm, but most transactions would be happening inside rollups, where actual fees paid by users would be hundreds of times lower."

2020-09-02 02:54:43,98,8,"However, increasing capacity is hard to do safely. Ethereum nodes are already running near their limits and there is always the risk of DoS attacks that are much slower to process than regular blocks, slowing the chain to a crawl. Higher gaslimits would exacerbate this."

2020-09-02 02:54:41,96,3,"The remaining transactors would see that blocks are partially empty, so if they lower their fees they would still get included. Hence, everyone would start lowering their fees. How low would they go? 465 gwei."

2020-09-02 02:54:40,122,3,"So what would happen? There would be more demand than there is space, so people would start bidding higher and higher txfees. How high would txfees go until enough people drop out that the remaining users make up only 12.5 million gas? Well, we know the answer: 465 gwei."

At the 100 gwei level, everyone who would be sending txs today would still be sending txs, but there would also be many more who are willing to send at 100, but not at 465."
2020-09-02 02:54:39,184,5,"First of all, why is the gasprice currently 465 gwei? Why isn't it 1000 gwei, or 100 gwei?
