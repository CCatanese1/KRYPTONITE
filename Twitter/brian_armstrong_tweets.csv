2021-08-19 22:50:33,33891,6065,We recently received board approval to purchase over $500M of crypto on our balance sheet to add to our existing holdings. And we'll be investing 10% of all profit going forward in crypto. I expect this percentage to keep growing over time as the cryptoeconomy matures.

Maybe we’ll see a book on how Coinbase works at some point!"
2021-08-19 11:59:05,64,3,"Unfortunately a lot of narratives told by outsiders are wildly inaccurate or, worse, reveal their own biases, such as a goal to tear down the company as a marketing tactic for their book."
2021-08-19 11:54:36,43,3,"Coinbase already implements a number of these processes. Others we need to recommit to.

What’s great about this book is it is a list of best practices told by insiders, instead of trying to tell the history of the company from an outsiders POV."

2021-08-11 12:55:31,663,99,Spot on as usual from @fredwilson 👌 https://t.co/OgWxCj5WSn
2021-08-10 20:47:17,442,36,"12/ We are also backers of @crypto_council which is just getting started, and will be an important resource. Follow them for future updates. There are still opportunities to mitigate this issue in the infrastructure bill, and we are just getting started."
2021-08-10 20:45:53,449,37,"11/ At @Coinbase, we will do everything we can to help you – and our 60+ million users – be heard, and to ensure that government decisions globally are made in a thoughtful way."
2021-08-10 20:45:29,460,45,10/ The biggest lesson of this has been that the crypto community is now an incredibly powerful constituent. Almost 80k of you contacted your senators urging them to do the right thing. Everyone in this country who sees the promise of crypto needs to stay engaged and be heard.
2021-08-10 20:45:14,423,44,"9/ We need to double down on educating our government on the promise of crypto. We welcome sensible and thoughtful regulation, but it can’t come at the expense of US innovation, US competitiveness, and US leadership in technology."
2021-08-10 20:45:02,381,37,"8/ There is an important lesson here for the crypto community: unfamiliarity with and suspicion of innovation, even among a few policymakers, can be extremely dangerous."
2021-08-10 20:44:49,486,51,7/ Someone who uses crypto to buy a cup of coffee or send money to their family should not be automatically subject to surveillance and reporting to the government beyond what we see in traditional financial services.
2021-08-10 20:44:38,335,31,"6/ There is much more work to be done in ensuring the implementation of Treasury’s new authority does not lead to abuse, particularly around protecting privacy. I know Senator @ronwyden is focused on this, as are we."
2021-08-10 20:44:17,384,39,"5/  Our goal here is simply parity with traditional finance. We should ensure that true brokers report tax info, but every other crypto ecosystem participant (of which there are many, with new ones being created all the time) are not penalized."
2021-08-10 20:44:10,434,38,"4/ Our work with policymakers will continue going forward. There is no question that tax reporting is enormously important, but nonsensical rules that are impossible to comply with don’t advance that goal."
2021-08-10 20:44:01,476,45,"3/ Sens. @SenLummis &amp; @sentoomey deserve special thanks for their leadership too, finding common ground with @UStreasury, @SenatorSinema, @senrobportman &amp; @MarkWarner on the crypto tax reporting language. This agreement should play a central role in Treasury’s implementation."
2021-08-10 20:43:51,598,50,"2/ Senator @RonWyden has been a stalwart in advancing sound tech policy, and he deserves enormous thanks and praise from the American people for his leadership and resolve in pushing for sensible crypto provisions in the infrastructure bill."
2021-08-10 20:43:44,4798,626,"1/ While the damaging language in the infrastructure bill remains, we all owe Sens. @RonWyden @SenLummis and @sentoomey enormous thanks for their work trying to protect innovation and the future of crypto in the United States."
2021-08-09 11:22:08,685,47,"By one measure it is getting harder and harder to get hired at Coinbase:

2021-08-06 20:41:13,6795,1925,"10/ Contact your Senators and urge them to vote for the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment and vote NO on the Warner-Portman amendment. Let’s keep crypto alive and thriving, we’re just getting started. https://t.co/gCPISrQSxQ"
2021-08-06 20:40:34,4089,514,"9/ History will not be kind to any politician who tries to block American's access to new technologies. Americans have a very low tolerance for taking away our rights, and harming economic growth."
2021-08-06 20:39:31,3425,395,8/ This debate in the Senate started because the govt sees the growing crypto industry as a source of tax revenue. We agree everyone must pay their taxes. There is no debate on this topic. But destroying some of the most exciting innovations in the process is unconscionable.
2021-08-06 20:39:18,3676,493,"7/ If the U.S. fails to embrace the innovation happening in crypto, it risks becoming a financial backwater, missing out on one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy. Imagine if we had missed out on the internet, and the largest internet companies had been built overseas."
2021-08-06 20:39:03,3211,364,"6/ Crypto is still in its early stages. Innovators across this country are working to make crypto networks better, enabling new apps like NFTs, smart contracts, and DeFi. These will bring enormous benefits to Americans, and help ensure our place as a financial hub."
2021-08-06 20:38:29,3506,451,"5/ Our Senators are voting tomorrow on the future of innovation in finance and crypto in America. If they choose the Sen.@MarkWarner amendment, we will see future development of blockchain technology move offshore to countries like China that are currently embracing it."
2021-08-06 20:38:13,4118,542,"4/ Imagine if the government decided that iOS is OK but Android isn’t. And that software developers building on iOS can thrive, but Android is outlawed."
2021-08-06 20:37:57,3475,366,"3/ This is the government trying to pick winners and losers in a nascent industry today, where some new technology is being developed every month. They are guaranteed to get it wrong, by writing in a few exceptions by hand today."
2021-08-06 20:37:32,3383,397,"2/ Senator @MarkWarner has asked for proof of stake validators to comply with the impossible, but not proof of work miners. Why? It’s not clear, but we could find ourselves with the Senate deciding which types of crypto will survive government regulation."
2021-08-06 20:37:13,22832,5863,1/ There are a few key moments that define our future. One is happening now in the Senate w/ the infrastructure bill. At the 11th hour @MarkWarner has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto. This is disastrous.
2021-08-06 18:21:34,348,19,I don't believe she is anti-crypto.
2021-08-06 18:21:06,630,86,"They are using @SenatorSinema's name as the third person in support of this, but we're hearing behind the scenes that she has asked to have her name taken off the list.

She should come out and say this publicly, or she'll wind up associated with this anti-crypto move."
2021-08-06 18:16:50,691,120,"The number of crypto holders in the U.S. is somewhere between 10 and 50 million. This is becoming a very powerful constituent.

It's surprising to me that Senators like @RobPortman and @MarkWarner are willing to go against this many Americans."
2021-08-06 18:13:38,2263,313,Just called - was pretty quick and painless. https://t.co/ARGqJ10kn8
2021-08-04 22:14:58,2099,765,"10/ We also need to ask all senators to remove the language requiring sweeping surveillance of crypto holders.

2021-08-04 22:14:50,1157,310,"9/ This will not happen without your elected reps hearing from you. Please contact your senators and ask them to support the amendment to the infrastructure bill proposed by @RonWyden, @SenToomey and @SenLummis (which gets us part way there by narrowing the definition of broker)."
2021-08-04 22:11:47,929,90,8/ Policymakers play a critical role in ensuring that tech innovation can flourish in the United States. I hope that they keep this in mind and don’t impose draconian burdens on an industry that will play a major role in the innovative future of our country.
2021-08-04 22:10:57,1261,132,7/ All we ask for is an even playing field with traditional finance that doesn't penalize cryptocurrency unfairly.
2021-08-04 22:10:45,1078,199,6/ The infrastructure bill also imposes sweeping and unprecedented reporting requirements that will force exchanges like Coinbase and others to surveil its customer’s transactions in a way that is more intrusive than the rest of traditional finance (Link: https://t.co/erninsSl0L)
2021-08-04 22:10:27,1286,134,"5/ Fortunately senators @RonWyden, @SenToomey, @SenLummis have an amendment that narrows the definition to intermediaries like @coinbase, who actually have the capacity to report, just like in the traditional financial system. (Link: https://t.co/h2MqMt7Fsf)"
2021-08-04 22:10:14,1012,105,"4/ This makes no sense. Smart contracts, for instance, are not companies, and cannot be modified to collect KYC info or issue 1099s. They are simply software running on the blockchain that anyone can use."
2021-08-04 22:09:56,831,85,"3/ But the bill defines “brokers” to include anyone who “effectuates transfers of digital assets.” This means almost anyone in the crypto ecosystem (miners, validators, smart contracts, open source developers etc) could be treated as a “broker” with massive reporting obligations."
2021-08-04 22:09:21,784,79,"2/ Coinbase is happy to help customers fulfill tax obligations just like the rest of the financial services industry. We've been doing this for years, and issuing more 1099s is a great idea.  https://t.co/CFagI7nnbm"
2021-08-04 22:09:14,4523,1262,"1/ If you’ve been following threads on the Infrastructure bill, you know that there is a hastily conceived provision related to digital assets. This provision could have a profound negative impact on crypto in the US and unintentionally push more innovation offshore."

2021-07-15 19:33:26,533,82,"9/ Crypto is simply providing an alternative for people who want more freedom. Everyone can make their own choice, and that is probably a good thing."
2021-07-15 19:33:09,298,22,"8/ Ultimately, everyone can choose the system that works best for them. For people who want more ""controls"" in place around their financial life, the fiat system is already there."
2021-07-15 19:29:50,434,62,"7/ Crypto is not going to solve wealth inequality - it's not trying to create the same outcome for everyone. But it does create wealth mobility and more equality of opportunity for everyone. It levels the playing field, at least to some degree."
2021-07-15 19:28:45,303,18,"6/ This is part of why Bitcoin has made so many people wealthy. It was not a security, so regular people could invest early on."
2021-07-15 19:28:29,380,41,"5/ Accredited investor laws are a good example. They were created with the best of intentions, to protect regular people from scams - a noble idea. But what has been the actual result? They've often made it illegal to get rich via investment, unless you're already rich."
2021-07-15 19:27:56,271,23,"4/ Check the countries of the world, and ask yourself if you'd rather live with more economic freedom or less. https://t.co/za9zmsisO8"
2021-07-15 19:27:22,329,35,"3/ You have to remember, free markets are messy. A lot of bad ideas need to get tried to find breakthroughs. People need to make their own choices. But history shows that they lead to better outcomes for everyone, even the poorest 10%. https://t.co/DuTOX0JIqH"
2021-07-15 19:26:55,443,46,"2/ If you believe government solutions are often inefficient, overpromise/underdeliver, and come with unintended consequences, and that personal responsibility mixed with free markets will create better outcomes for everyone, then crypto is a much needed breath of fresh air."
2021-07-15 19:25:07,1178,208,"1/ All depends on your perspective...if you believe the government should be the solution to people's problems, then the fiat system with its ""controls"" has a lot to offer. https://t.co/JCwhQW9nLT"

2021-07-02 18:22:14,150,16,"A lot of startup advice falls into this category: if you're not embarrassed by your first launch you waited too long.

2021-05-15 02:16:40,472,31,19/ Speaker Pelosi @teampelosi https://t.co/dcFAgd0mJt
2021-05-15 02:14:44,287,16,18/ Here are a few fun photos - I only got permission to post a few (there were a lot more meetings where I didn't!). Btw Coinbase is committed to being bipartisan in any policy efforts.
2021-05-15 02:14:23,269,15,"17/ Coinbase stands ready to help as a resource for all those who would like to learn more about crypto, and help drive toward regulatory clarity, and innovation."
2021-05-15 02:14:02,304,24,"16/ Including banking the unbanked (and underbanked), which crypto has the potential to do (especially self-hosted wallets)."
2021-05-15 02:12:34,331,20,"15/ Coinbase provides services to customers in over 100 countries around the world, and we're seeking to speak with policy makers everywhere. But our parent company is based in the U.S. and I'd love to see the U.S. embrace the exciting use cases of this new industry."
2021-05-15 02:11:10,559,98,"14/ I also relayed my thoughts on China and their central bank digital currency. It is real, they are moving quickly on it, and I believe it represents a threat to U.S. reserve currency status long term if the U.S. doesn't move quickly to create their own."
2021-05-15 02:09:24,332,28,"13/ Side note: great example of why government is best suited to set the legal and policy frameworks, but not try to pick winners. The two companies they chose to represent the future of the internet were IBM and another one I haven't heard of!"
2021-05-15 02:09:05,306,17,"12/ Al Gore outlines the government's role to ""first do no harm"", to applause, and sets the stage for a safe industry with appropriate consumer protection. Think about the downstream effects we have today of this signal they sent to the market."
2021-05-15 02:08:45,341,41,11/ Credit to @FEhrsam and @crypto_council for finding this gem - but watch this amazing video of the Al Gore and the Clinton administration announcing the Electronic Commerce Initiative in 1997 https://t.co/Sw0ddoo5c3
2021-05-15 02:08:32,463,39,"10/ Also, a signal from the current administration that crypto companies are welcome in the U.S. would go a long way."
2021-05-15 02:08:12,542,51,"9/ One of my biggest takeaways is that the U.S. could really use a safe harbor/sandbox for crypto startups to get off the ground, before having to grapple with these issues. This would go a long way, and give the SEC/CFTC/Treasury/etc a common framework to follow."
2021-05-15 02:07:41,392,36,"8/ Coinbase is big enough to afford the legal costs, and we’ve proactively created our own self regulatory frameworks when needed (for example https://t.co/9yJot946Jy). Smaller crypto startups are more harmed because they can't always afford it early on."
2021-05-15 02:07:23,372,21,"7/ So it's a bit of a jump ball across existing federal regulators, and this means fewer startups who are able to brave the legal uncertainty. Some of them wind up founding their companies abroad, or not at all. This is a major problem."
2021-05-15 02:06:30,478,49,"6/ There is not a ton of regulatory clarity today in the U.S. because crypto is not just one thing. Some cryptos might be securities (SEC), some are commodities (CFTC), some are currencies/property (Treasury/IRS), and some are none of the above."
2021-05-15 02:06:02,325,14,"5/ The politicians and agency heads I met with were all thoughtful and committed individuals, and I was happy to have our teams connected, and new friendships formed."
2021-05-15 02:05:35,408,25,"4/ The reactions ranged from very positive (those who see enormous potential) like @SenatorSinema and @PatrickMcHenry, to admitted skeptics who asked thoughtful questions about illicit activity and I think left with a much more open mind like @MarkWarner, and everyone in between."
2021-05-15 02:03:31,676,82,"3/ Crypto is as important as the birth of the internet in terms of the jobs, GDP growth, and innovation it can create. The U.S. will need to be a major player in crypto to stay relevant long term."
2021-05-15 02:03:06,497,32,"2/ Goal was to establish relationships and help answer questions about crypto. And to see what we can do to help the U.S. get more regulatory clarity in this space, as part of the newly formed @crypto_council."
2021-05-15 02:02:37,2912,554,"1/ I spent most of this week in DC meeting with members of Congress and heads of various federal agencies, along with @RonConway @katie_haun and @iampaulgrewal."
2021-05-14 18:02:19,1666,89,"This has served us well over the last 9 years, and I expect it will continue to do so over the next 9 years. In terms of long term focus, we are still at the very beginning of this journey. Let's keep building!"
2021-05-14 18:02:13,2720,417,"I like to tell my team: If you can't ignore the hype while things are trending up, then you can't ignore the despair when things are trending down. We need to develop resilience, ignore the noise, and continually make forward progress on our mission."
2021-05-14 18:02:00,1052,66,"It makes no difference to me; we will keep building and moving forward, because I want to see a world with more economic freedom, and this is the best opportunity I see to create it."
2021-05-14 18:01:56,862,78,"Times feel good right now. But when this current cycle ends we may see crypto prices fall, and some people will become disillusioned and walk away from crypto (again)."
2021-05-14 18:01:05,822,54,"Importantly, we had to maintain that same mindset during the periods of excitement around Coinbase and crypto. There are just as many risks to getting caught up in your own hype as there are in giving up when times are tough."
2021-05-14 18:00:49,1268,65,"It was during the company’s low periods that I worked to find balance and avoid getting distracted. It was only because of perseverance and focus that we made it through those hard periods where we lost many employees, partners, or public support."
2021-05-14 18:00:01,979,42,"It’s tempting to get caught up in the excitement of the current moment, but the truth is there have been many ups and downs of the 9 years."
2021-05-14 17:59:54,1313,72,"I’m grateful to see how far crypto has come since Coinbase was founded. Hard to imagine that only 9 years later we would see crypto regularly discussed by Presidents, Saturday Night Live hosts, and Tom Brady. Or that it would show up in songs by Nas."
2021-05-14 17:59:45,18343,2217,"9 years ago today, I founded Coinbase. One of the most important lessons I come back after all this time is long-term focus."
2021-05-12 21:29:45,942,103,"Going all in on remote first. Important to continue being an innovative company, that attracts top talent from everywhere, and can move quick. https://t.co/VOdqKV4CEJ"

2021-04-14 20:41:48,733,61,24/ Higher economic freedom correlates with the kind of societies that we all aspire to create. Our job at Coinbase is to help make this future a reality.
2021-04-14 20:41:39,764,100,"23/ Societies with greater economic freedom have higher GDP growth and life expectancy, less war and corruption, better treatment of the environment, and higher income of the poorest 10% of people in society."
2021-04-14 20:41:25,711,88,"22/ Crypto can provide the basics of economic freedom to anyone: property rights, sound money, free trade, and the ability to work how and where they want."
2021-04-14 20:41:12,469,32,"21/ Looking to the future, we've only accomplished a small fraction of what we set out to do as a company."
2021-04-14 20:40:50,810,70,20/ There’s a saying that the best way to predict the future is to create it. Hopefully we helped make the future happen a little sooner than it otherwise would have in the crypto space.
2021-04-14 20:40:28,560,40,19/ The cryptoeconomy today is nothing like the ecosystem that existed when we launched Coinbase 9 years ago. And it’s nothing like the ecosystem that will exist 9 years from now.
2021-04-14 20:40:15,483,31,"18/ But we got through it, and it made the company and our platform stronger. We discovered our weaknesses and spent the next year hiring an experienced exec team and rearchitecting all our systems. Things improved, but the job is never done as we keep growing."
2021-04-14 20:40:00,528,34,"17/ This was a tough period for the company and our employees. We weren’t meeting our customers’ expectations when it came to site reliability or customer support. We knew we needed to do better. Employees were back to sleeping in the office, pulling 100 hour weeks."
2021-04-14 20:39:45,508,30,"16/ But perhaps the most challenging time for Coinbase was in the fall/winter of 2017/18. Fueled by a boom in ICOs, we experienced a surge in trading volumes like nothing we had ever seen before. Virtually overnight, we saw 10x our average volumes."
2021-04-14 20:39:31,510,29,"15/ With a passport and a suitcase, @dwr spent months meeting with regulators and banks throughout the UK and EU until we secured our first banking relationship outside the U.S. His work opened the door for the business we have throughout Europe to this day."
2021-04-14 20:39:16,528,33,"14/ Fast forward a couple of years and a few crypto cycles, and we knew that for Coinbase to achieve what we set out to achieve, we would have to look beyond the US. Crypto is an inherently global innovation. We needed to be too."
2021-04-14 20:38:59,753,47,13/ Our culture was a unique blend. We identified with early cypherpunks but were also willing to do the work necessary to be a regulated financial services company. We’d go from meeting banks to anarchists in a day. We had to bridge the divide and speak both languages.
2021-04-14 20:38:35,725,47,"12/ The hours were long and the work was hard (employees eating and sleeping in the office was not uncommon), but we made it work because we were all bound by a common mission. Many opted to take part of their salary in Bitcoin, including myself."
2021-04-14 20:37:28,886,65,"11/ Our first office was a small loft in SF’s SoMa district that we quickly outgrew. We had early employees working in the laundry room (between washing cycles), in the bathroom, and the hallways. Some even camped out on the roof. https://t.co/zsxCgYgQJZ"
2021-04-14 20:35:58,889,63,"10/ After meeting with more than 50 possible partners (it’s a lot like dating), I met @FEhrsam through Reddit and we set out to build Coinbase. https://t.co/7PVzUEFzYb"
2021-04-14 20:32:42,632,46,"9/ The next decision I had to make probably had the most impact on Coinbase today: my choice of cofounder. I needed someone that I could trust implicitly, balance my strengths and weaknesses, and share my vision for crypto and economic freedom."

2021-04-14 20:23:04,1521,107,"7/ I’m forever thankful to @paulg, @sama, @garrytan and @ycombinator for giving me a chance and guiding me. Their $150k first check helped me believe in myself and gave me the courage to quit my job and really try building a company. It was the first legitimizer of a crazy idea."
2021-04-14 20:21:47,1603,151,"6/ It’s hard to overstate how bad of an idea everyone thought Coinbase was. Friends in tech said they didn’t get it or that it was a scam. I had a lot of self doubt personally, and thought maybe I was crazy for being so interested in it."
2021-04-14 20:21:26,911,67,"5/ After reading it, I started coding an early prototype of Coinbase on nights and weekends, and began attending early bitcoin meetups around the Bay Area. Eventually I was accepted at @YCombinator and got the courage to quit my job @Airbnb to go pursue this crazy idea."
2021-04-14 20:20:08,809,53,"4/ While the Coinbase app has evolved a lot since then (It was first called Bitbank until I learned that “bank” carries a very specific legal, regulatory definition!), the mission is the same: to increase economic freedom in the world."
2021-04-14 20:19:49,1096,131,3/ This has driven me ever since as I believe creating more economic freedom is one of the biggest meta problems of our time. It has so many positive downstream effects in society. https://t.co/DuTOX11jif
2021-04-14 20:19:35,1266,108,"2/ The Coinbase journey started when I read the Satoshi whitepaper while I was home for Thanksgiving in 2010. As I read it, I realized that crypto had the power to unlock a future where economic freedom was a reality for everyone."
